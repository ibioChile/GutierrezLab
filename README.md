# GutierrezLab

We are currently taking a systems biology approach (Gutiérrez, 2012, Gutiérrez et al., 2005) to understand how nitrogen-induced responses are coordinated with other processes in the plant to coordinate growth and development in a changing environment.
Our research has both basic and applied significance. Understanding how plants respond to nutrient and how this regulation is integrated with other processes is essential to devise strategies for the improvement of agronomical traits.

This repository contains code, data and files generated and used by Gutiérrez's lab members.
