 # Differential allelic expression analysis
 
 This pipeline explains how to screen genes for allele-specific expression among different conditions. The workflow starts with the generation of RNA libraries from the genotypes Arabidopsis Landsberg erecta & Llagostera. Libraries are generated from parental and hybrid genotypes. Overall, the following pipeline follows the next steps:
 
 1. Assembly of the transcriptome of Landsberg.
 2. Calling of discriminant SNPs between Landsberg erecta and Llagostera.
 3. Differential expression among parental genotypes.
 4. Estimate allele-specific expression among hybrids.
